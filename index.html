<p>Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century in Europe and as of 2003,<br /> 
more than 1 billion have been produced worldwide, <br />
twice as many as the number of automobiles that have been produced.<br />
They are the principal means of transportation in many regions. <br />
They also provide a popular form of recreation, <br />
and have been adapted for use as children's toys, general fitness, <br />
military and police applications, courier services, and bicycle racing. </p>
